## To make this game at home yourself you need four things:

* a Mac computer. To make Apple apps (known as iOS apps) you need to a Mac computer, from Apple, so you can download the Xcode application, used to develop iOS apps. You can’t make iOS apps on a Windows computer (not legally/easily anyway!)


* an iPhone or iPad to play it on that is compatible with Apple’s ARKit (more of what exactly that is shortly): iPhone 6S and upwards, 5th Generation iPads and iPad Pro.


* I'm going to presume that you know how to code! Or at least, are learning how to code. If you’ve never coded before, this game will be too advanced. Don’t worry though, there’s plenty of fantastic online resources to learn how to code. Ideally, you will have had experience making iOS apps before and know your way around Xcode.


* Time and patience! This is a big piece of code! Very big! I'm go through pretty much everything and are aiming it at beginners (as im hope kids who play the game are inspired to try build it), so there’s a tonne of detail in here. So feel free to do it over a few days, or weeks! Or if you’re an experienced engineer, just skip past anything that bores you!
